# Python-assignment-Hangman-Game-Model-
This project is a fun take on the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game will have a simple and user-friendly interface, showing the word as a series of blanks and updating with each correct guess. Players will need to guess within a limited number of tries.

# Python-assignment-Hangman-Game-Model (Section 18)

# 📜 Description
This project is a fun take on the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game features a simple and user-friendly interface powered by Pygame, displaying the word as a series of blanks and updating with each correct guess.
Players will select letters using interactive buttons, aiming to solve the word within a limited number of tries before the Hangman figure is fully drawn. The game includes random word selection for fresh challenges in every round and visually tracks incorrect guesses through a dynamic Hangman graphic.

# Complete Project Setup Guide 
  ## 1. System Requirements  
  - **Python 3.8+** ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  
  - **Git** ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/))  
  - **Pip** (Comes with Python)  

  * (Recommended: 64-bit OS for better compatibility.)*  

  ## **📥 2. Clone the Repository**  
  1. Open `Terminal (Mac/Linux)` or `Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows)`
  2. Run:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/Henos811/Python-assignment-Hangman-Game-Model-.git
      cd Python-assignment-Hangman-Game-Model-
      ```

  ## **🐍 3. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**  

  ### **Create & Activate the Virtual Environment**  
  #### **Windows (PowerShell):**
      python -m venv .venv
      .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    
  #### **Mac/Linux (Terminal):**
    
      python3 -m venv .venv
      source .venv/bin/activate
    
  ✅ **Success?** You should see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.  


  ## **📦 4. Install Dependencies**  
  The project uses `requirements.txt` to manage dependencies.  

  1. Make sure your virtual environment is **activated**.  
  2. Run: 
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ````
      (This installs Pygame and all other required packages.) 

  ## **🚀 5. Run the Project**  
  1. Ensure the virtual environment is **activated**.  
  2. Run the main script:   ```` python main.py ````

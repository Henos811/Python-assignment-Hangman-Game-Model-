# Python-assignment-Hangman-Game-Model (Section 18)

## Description
  This project is a fun take on the classic Hangman game, where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The game will have a simple and user-friendly            interface, showing the word as a series of blanks and updating with each correct guess. Players will need to guess within a limited number of tries.

## Instructions on how to set up and run the project
  1. Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your PC. This is the primary programming language used for the project.
  2. To set up your virtual environment type this in your terminal:<br>
    - python -m venv .venv <br>
        .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows <br>
        source .venv/bin/activate # Mac/Linux <br>
  3. To install dependencies type this in your terminal: <br>
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
  


## Features
  In our Hangman game project, each letter of the alphabet is displayed as a button on the screen. This setup lets players simply click on their guesses instead of      typing them out. The buttons are easy to see and clearly labeled, making it simple to identify which letters are still available. The game randomly selects a word     from a predefined list for each round, ensuring a fresh challenge every time. When a player clicks on a button, their guess is registered, and the game updates        accordingly. If they guess correctly, the corresponding letters appear in the word, while incorrect guesses add to the hangman graphic.
